    - This project uses an external css and js library to make the image slideshow in the Home page, the pull out tab for the hamburger, account and shopping cart in the nav-bar, to close these tabs and the specialised search bar for mobile format.
    - It also makes simple icons like arrows or social media logos easy to add.
